- What is Recursion ?

    The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.

- Why to use Recursion ?

    Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.

- What is Base Condition ?

    In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems. In short base condition is a condition from were the flow of program start to return.

    - example:

        ```c
        int fact(int n)
        {
            if (n < = 1) // base case
                return 1;
            else    
                return n*fact(n-1);    
        }
        ```

- How a particular problem is solved using recursion?

    The idea is to represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems, and add one or more base conditions that stop the recursion. For example, we compute factorial n if we know factorial of (n-1). The base case for factorial would be n = 0. We return 1 when n = 0.

- Why Stack Overflow error occurs in recursion?

    If the base case is not reached or not defined, then the stack overflow problem may arise.
